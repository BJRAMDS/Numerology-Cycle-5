# 🧠 Voro8 / TITAN: Numerology Operating System

Welcome to your **personalized journaling system** powered by numerology, reflection, and contextual intelligence. This system—anchored in daily intention and numerical alignment—is designed to track behavior, spark insight, and evolve with you.

---

## 🛠️ System Purpose

**Voro8** is a daily introspection and decision-tracking framework that blends numerology, behavioral prompts, and adaptive intelligence through modular files. Designed within the TITAN Deciders framework, it empowers structured evolution via:

- ✍️ **Journaling prompts**
- 🔢 **Numerology signals**
- 🌀 **Context sync logs**
- 🧱 **Modular identity trackers**
- 🔁 **Virtue-based action loops**

Each file and folder contributes to a behavior-based operating system where you are the central agent of awareness and iteration.

## 📌 Developer Notes

- This file map reflects the **current, committed structure** as of today’s push.
- All modules in this structure are considered functional or minimally scaffolded for core interaction.
- No placeholder or TODO files are included here—this README is meant to serve developers syncing in or cloning the repo to understand the working system.

---

## 🔧 Next Steps (Optional / Not in This Push)

While the following files are under consideration, they are *not* included in this current commit:

- `prompt_generator/indecision_loop.js` → For TITAN 24hr decision countdown.
- `reflections/sync_reflection_to_mal.js` → For pushing data into the MAL layer.

These will be added in future development cycles and will follow this structural pattern once stabilized.

---

## 🔄 Integration Philosophy

This system is aligned with the TITAN Deciders framework and follows principles of:

- Memory as Layer (MAL)
- Judgment Core & Ethical Compass
- Indecision Loop resolution
- Quadrant-based identity mapping

Your role as a developer is to treat each script not just as utility, but as part of an evolving cognitive engine.

Stay synced. Stay intentional. This is Voro8.
